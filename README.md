# slave_trade_voyages
This repository is a (personal) way to engage with the history of slavery from the data science perspective.


# On the Dataset
https://www.slavevoyages.org provides dataset on the trans-Atlantic and intra-American slave trade since 1999.
This present repository thus holds files I downloaded from their website to help me understand the data as well
as well as notebooks and plots generated from the Trans-Atlantic and Intra-American Slave Trade Databases. 

 
# Some Findings and Insights from a Preliminary EDA (Check the Plots-folder for the visualization)

1. Only 50% of the vessels completed their voyages as intended. 5% of the vessels arriving in Africa have a 
subsequent fate that is unknown. 10% of the vessels left their home ports and were never heard of again. 

2. More than 30% of the slaving ships flew the flag of Great Britain. Portugal around 15%, Spain 4% and the USA
5%. A little bit more than a quarter of the flags were not specified.

3. Mary, Nancy, NS do Rosario S Antônio e Almas, NS da Conceição S Antônio e Almas were the most common ship 
names. 

4. Ships essentially flew the flag of the territory where they were constructed.

# slave_trade_voyages
This repository is a (personal) way to engage with the history of slavery from the data science perspective.
# On the Dataset
https://www.slavevoyages.org provides dataset on the trans-Atlantic and intra-American slave trade since 1999.
This present repository thus holds files I downloaded from their website to help me understand the data as well
as well as notebooks and plots generated from the Trans-Atlantic and Intra-American Slave Trade Databases.
